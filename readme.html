<h1>Getting Started With rss2email</h1>

<h2 id="windows">Instructions for Windows Users</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Before you install rss2email, you'll need to make sure that a few
things are in place. First, is that a version
of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> 2.x installed. Second,
determine your outgoing email server's address. That should be all you
need.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new directory.</li>
  <li>Download the latest rss2email <code>.ZIP</code> file and unzip to
    the new directory.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configure</h3>

<p>Edit the configuration file and fill in your outoing email server's
details. If your server requires you to login,
change <code>AUTHREQUIRED = 0</code> to <code>AUTHREQUIRED = 1</code>
and enter your email username and password.</p>

<h3>Install</h3>

<p>From the command line, change to the directory you created, and
just run <code>r2e</code> from this directory.  For basic usage
guidelines, look <a href="#usage">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Automating rss2email</h3>

<p>More than likely you will want rss2email to run automatically at a
regular interval. Under Windows this is can be easily accomplished
using the Windows Task Scheduler. This site has a
nice <a href="http://www.iopus.com/guides/winscheduler.htm">tutorial</a>
on it. Just select <code>r2e.bat</code> as the program to run. Once
you've created the task, double click on it in the task list and
change the Run entry so that <code>run</code> comes
after <code>r2e.bat</code>. For example, if you installed rss2email in
the <code>C:\rss2email</code> directory, then you would change the Run
entry from <code>C:\rss2email\r2e.bat</code>
to <code>C:\rss2email\r2e.bat run</code>.</p>

<p>Now jump down to the section on <a href="#customize">customizing
rss2email</a> to your needs.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to a new version</h3>

<p>Simply replace all of the files in your install
directory <strong>EXCEPT your config file</strong> with new versions
from the <code>.ZIP</code> package.</p>

<h2 id="unix">Instructions for UNIX/Linux Users</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Before you install rss2email, you'll need to make sure that a few
things are in place: a version
of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> 2.x and sendmail (or a
compatible replacement like postfix) installed. If sendmail isn't
installed, determine your outgoing email server's address. That should
be all you need.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>A quick way to get rss2email going is using pre-made packages. Here
are releases for
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?searchon=names&amp;version=all&amp;exact=1&amp;keywords=rss2email">Debian</a> Linux,
<a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=rss2email&searchon=names&section=all">Ubuntu</a> Linux,
and
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/pkgsrc/mail/rss2email/README.html">NetBSD</a>.</p>

<p>If you are unable to use these packages or you want the latest and
greatest version, here's what you do:</p>

<pre>
$ tar xvf rss2email-*.tar.gz
$ mv rss2email-* /path/to/install/location/
$ cd /path/to/install/location
$ chmod +x r2e
</pre>

<p>You can run <code>r2e</code> from this directory or add the
installation directory to your <code>PATH</code>.  For basic usage
guidelines, look <a href="#usage">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to a new version</h3>

<p>Simply replace all of the files in your install
directory <strong>EXCEPT your config file</strong> with new versions
from the <code>.tar.gz</code> package.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Using rss2email</h2>

</p>Create a new feed database to send updates to your email
address:</p>

<pre>
r2e new you@yourdomain.com
</pre>

<p>Subscribe to some feeds:</p>

<pre>
r2e add http://feeds.feedburner.com/allthingsrss/hJBr
</pre>

<p>That's the feed to be notified when there's a new version of
rss2email. Repeat this for each feed you want to subscribe to.</p>

<p>When you run rss2email, it emails you about every story it hasn't
seen before. But the first time you run it, that will be every
story. To avoid this, you can ask rss2email not to send you any
stories the first time you run it:</p>

<pre>
r2e run --no-send
</pre>

<p>Then later, you can ask it to email you new stories:</p>

<pre>
r2e run
</pre>

<p>If you get an error message <code>Sender domain must exist</code>,
add a line to your configuration file like this:</p>

<pre>
DEFAULT_FROM = rss2email@yoursite.com
</pre>

<p>You can make the email address whatever you want, but your mail
server requires that the <code>yoursite.com</code> part actually
exists.</p>

<h2 id="customize">Customize rss2email</h2>

<p>There are a number of options, described in full at the top of
<code>rss2email.py</code> file, to customize the way rss2email
behaves. If you want to change something, edit the the configuration
file. You may have to create this file if it doesn't already
exist.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to receive HTML mail, instead of having
entries converted to plain text:</p>

<pre>
HTML_MAIL = 1
</pre>

<p>To be notified every time a post changes, instead of just when it's
first posted:</p>

<pre>
TRUST_GUID = 0
</pre>

<p>And to make the emails look as if they were sent when the item was
posted:</p>

<pre>
DATE_HEADER = 1
</pre>

</body>
